  Delivers a structured stock analysis with trend strength, analyst consensus, price targets, risk factors, and a soft Buy/Hold/Sell signal — all rendered as a visual dashboard widget. Use this skill whenever the user asks for stock analysis, wants to know if a stock is worth buying or holding, asks for a buy/sell/hold recommendation, wants to evaluate a ticker for long-term holding, or asks about stock trends, price targets, or analyst ratings. Trigger even for casual phrasings like "should I buy AMD?", "how is NVDA doing?", "is TSLA worth holding for a year?", or "give me a stock breakdown for X".

# Stock Analysis Skill

Produces a full stock analysis dashboard for any ticker: live price data, momentum indicators, analyst consensus, price targets, key risks, and a soft Buy / Hold / Sell signal rendered as an inline visual widget.

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Required | Description | Example |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| ticker | string | Yes | Stock ticker symbol or company name to analyze | "AAPL", "NVDA", "Tesla", "TSLA" |

## Workflow

### 1. Identify the ticker
Extract the stock ticker or company name from the user's request. If ambiguous (e.g. "Apple" could be AAPL), confirm before proceeding.

### 2. Gather data via web search
Run **two searches in parallel** (or sequentially if parallel isn't available):

**Search A — price & momentum:**
```
{TICKER} stock price analysis {current month} {current year}
```

**Search B — analyst targets & outlook:**
```
{TICKER} stock analyst price target forecast {current year}
```

Extract the following from results:
- Current price and today's % change
- 1-week, 1-month, 1-year % changes
- Recent price milestones or streaks (ATH, win streaks, etc.)
- Upcoming earnings date
- Revenue/EPS growth projections
- Analyst consensus breakdown (Strong Buy / Buy / Hold / Sell counts and %)
- Individual analyst price targets (at least 2–3 named firms)
- Wall Street consensus average target
- Morningstar or similar fair value estimate (if available)
- Bull / base / bear case price targets for 1-year horizon
- Key risks (supply chain, competition, geopolitical, macro, valuation, etc.)
- Key catalysts (product launches, partnerships, earnings beats, sector tailwinds)

### 3. Determine the soft signal

Apply this scoring rubric to decide the signal label:

| Factor | Bullish (+1) | Neutral (0) | Bearish (−1) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Analyst consensus | >70% Buy/Strong Buy | 40–70% Buy | <40% Buy |
| 1-month price vs. avg target | <90% of target | 90–105% of target | >105% of target |
| Revenue growth (YoY) | >20% | 5–20% | <5% |
| EPS growth | >20% | 0–20% | Declining |
| Institutional flows | Net inflows | Mixed | Net outflows |
| Macro/sector trend | Tailwind | Neutral | Headwind |

**Signal thresholds:**
- Score ≥ 3 → **BUY**
- Score 1–2 → **HOLD / cautious BUY**
- Score 0 → **HOLD**
- Score ≤ −1 → **HOLD / cautious SELL** or **SELL**

Always label the signal as "soft" and include a 1–2 sentence rationale.

### 4. Render the dashboard widget

Use the `visualize:show_widget` tool to render an inline HTML dashboard. The widget must include:

**Metric cards row (4 cards):**
- Current price + today's % change
- 1-week change
- 1-month change
- 1-year change

**Two-column row:**
- Left card: analyst consensus bar chart (Strong Buy / Buy / Hold / Sell bars with %)
- Right card: price targets table (named firms + avg + bull/bear)

**Two-column row:**
- Left card: trend strength indicators (earnings surprise, revenue growth, EPS growth, institutional flows, key streaks) — each as a row with a green/amber badge
- Right card: key risks (each as a row with a red/amber/yellow badge by severity)

**Signal box (full width):**
- Colored box: blue border/bg for Hold-BUY, green for BUY, amber for HOLD, red for SELL
- Large signal label + 2-sentence rationale
- Upcoming catalyst callout if relevant (e.g. earnings date)

**Disclaimer line:** "This is not financial advice. Always consult a licensed financial advisor before making investment decisions."

#### Widget design rules
- Use CSS variables for all colors (dark mode safe)
- No hardcoded hex except inside Chart.js canvas calls
- Metric cards use `background: var(--color-background-secondary)`
- Detail cards use `background: var(--color-background-primary)` with `0.5px solid var(--color-border-tertiary)` border
- Badge colors: green badges for positive indicators, amber for medium risk, red for high risk
- Signal box uses `border: 2px solid` with semantic color matching the signal
- Font sizes: metric value = 22px/500, card labels = 12px, body = 13px
- Always include `<h2 class="sr-only">` screen-reader summary

### 5. Write a prose summary

After the widget, write 4–6 short paragraphs in plain conversational prose covering:
1. **Price & momentum** — what's driving the recent move
2. **What's driving it** — product launches, partnerships, sector trends
3. **Analyst view** — consensus and notable individual calls
4. **1-year hold outlook** — bull/base/bear case briefly
5. **The key risk right now** — the single most important near-term concern
6. **Signal rationale** — 1–2 sentences restating the soft signal and why

Use `` tags to cite web search sources inline.

Always end with: *Not financial advice — please consult a licensed financial advisor for personalized guidance.*

## Edge Cases

- **Unknown ticker**: Search for the company name to confirm the ticker before proceeding.
- **Very small/illiquid stocks**: Note limited analyst coverage and increase risk weighting.
- **Pre-earnings**: Flag the earnings date prominently in the signal box as a "watch" item.
- **Crypto/ETF**: The same workflow applies; adapt labels as needed (e.g. no "analyst consensus" for crypto — use on-chain metrics or sentiment instead, and note the difference).
- **No 1-year data**: Use available timeframes and note the gap.
- **Conflicting sources**: Prefer the most recent data; note conflicts if material.
